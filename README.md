# Co-Write

Have you ever lost a grade due to your professor marking your assignment as "used AI" falsely?

[Are you tired of the high error rate of AI detection software, making it an annoyance to grade your students?](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/)

Enter Co-Write.

CoWriter provides targeted AI assistance within professor-defined boundaries, making it a key component for all student infrastructure applications. We help students and professors set up and submit assignments while maintaining academic integrity and learning objectives, making it fun for both the profs and the students.

## Features of Co-Write

### For Professors:

- **Create Assignments:** Easily set up assignments with details like titles, descriptions, and document attachments for contextual AI assistance using RAGs and specific AI limitations.
- **Control AI Use:** Define limitations for OpenAI access to ensure students stay on track and complete assignments independently. We help preserve academic integrity and learning objectives.

### For Students:

- **Targeted Assistance:** Leverage CoWriter's RAG implementation for targeted AI assistance within professor-defined boundaries getting a head start on understanding assignments. Be able to use AI on your test/essay guilt-free.
- **Smart Prompts:** Utilize the built-in machine learning model to determine if your prompt needs general help or clarification, or if it's a direct request for answer generation (which may be restricted).
- **Adaptive OpenAI Integration:** Access OpenAI's capabilities when professors provide resources, but with limitations to prevent plagiarism and encourage independent work.

## Future Plans:

- Use CoWriter seamlessly within the Canvas interface you're already familiar with.

## Technologies:

- **Front-End:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **Back-End:** FastAPI, MongoDB
- **AI:** LangChain
